    "\n",
    "It is also very common to make small errors in your code, and the code does not\n",
    "work as you intended. So it is also very important to understand what is\n",
    "happening here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you should know is that there is something called **syntax**. A\n",
    "**syntax** defines how a language can be read. Since a computer can only follow\n",
    "very strict rules, it is very important to get the **syntax** correct,\n",
    "otherwise the computer does not know what you want to tell it. On close\n",
    "observation you can see that numbers after `forward` and `turn` are in\n",
    "parentheses `()`. This is part of the **syntax** and very important for the\n",
    "computer. You can try what happens if you leave them away.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another type of error is the **semantic** error. A **semantic** error does not\n",
    "lead to a crash of the program, but the program does not behave how you\n",
    "intended it. **Semantic** errors are quite common and sometimes very hard to\n",
    "spot. To spot a **semantic** error, you have to understand the program\n",
    "completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very easy to make **semantic** errors in the code above, since we have\n",
    "not discussed it in detail. I.e. maybe you added the new instructions at the\n",
    "end of the cell, after the line with `show()`. This would be perfectly fine,\n",
    "but it does not lead to the intended behavior. We want the turtle to execute\n",
    "all the code, and then show the image it drew. If we add the instructions after\n",
    "the line with `show()` you can see that these instructions are not drawn onto\n",
    "the image. You can check that for yourself, just add some instructions before\n",
