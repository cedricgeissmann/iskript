    "# Webserver\n",
    "\n",
    "A **webserver** is a programm that runs on a computer somewhere on the internet and that serves webrequests like websites and similar things. The static websites that we built so far are not a typical usecase for a **webserver**. A **webserver** also handles authentication of a user and queries databases if neccessary. In todays internet it is also often the case that a **webserver** not only serves some websites, but rather the plain data usually in form of **JSON**. The **webserver** therefore acts as a middle man for accessig data on a database. Let's focus on serving websites first.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flask** is another **Python** framework that implements a very basic **webserver**. There are more complex frameworks out there that provide the whole **webserver** experience with an admin panel and a database view and everything, but these frameworks are very large and we don't need all these functions anyways so we can use a simpler framework and learn everything yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Serving a Website with Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "Serving a **website** with **Flask** is very easy. We just tell **Flask** to setup a server and listen on certain `routes`. If one of these `routes` is accessed, we render a template and send it back to the user. If another `route` is accessed, we send an error that the page in not available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the code cell below you can find a minimal example of a **Flask** app that renders a website when the correct `route` is accessed. Execute the cell below, you should then see a `*` in the top left.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Hint:** If you run this on myBinder.org you cannot access the website directly... We have to use al little trick to circumvent this issue. Just open the notebook `Browser.ipynb` that is located next to this notebook, and execute the first cell in there!"
